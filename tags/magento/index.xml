      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WooCommerce&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Magento&lt;/strong&gt; proudly stand as two of the most popular e-commerce solutions that power jointly nearly 40% of all e-stores on the web. While both have their strengths and weaknesses, it becomes quite challenging for a merchant to choose the best one amongst the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is aimed to help you give the answer to an ultimate question: &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s better for your business?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This could sound weird, but should be strong as &lt;em&gt;think global, act local&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;work on remote server&lt;/strong&gt;, locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many programmers are using Mac, while some other developers are taking advantages of Linux latest technologies (such as Docker). Other people are just so old school, they still using the Microsoft and we have to respect that, if that works (and it should actually).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Meet Magento 2017 Romania</title>
      <link>https://www.avramescu.net/meet-magento-2017-romania/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I was excited and honoured to have a workshop at Meet Magento 2017 Romania on October 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the arrival, the venue Grand Hotel Italia was great and we were very warm welcome, especially after a longer flight time because of the weather conditions (more precisely the airport was closed due to an intense fog and the airplane had to make circles in the air for about one hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organisers did a really great job and they switched my speech. Ben Marks cooled me down with a bottle of water, which proved more than useful for my emotions which I usually have when I present in public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nordic Web Team organised Meet Magento 2017 Sweden for the second time, in Stockholm. The event toked place in Münchenbryggeriet (or the “Brewery Conference Center”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being in the panel moderator a year ago, this time I had the pleasure to talk on my first public presentation, which Nexcess described it being &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;a particularly interesting talk about Kubernetes and Magento 2&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
